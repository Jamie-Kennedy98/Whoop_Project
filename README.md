# Whoop_Project
An analysis of my personal Whoop data. This analysis includes an exploration of the data followed by predictive modelling carried out using AWS Sagemaker.

Need to mention where to get data e.g. download whoop data and then provide link to met eireann website to download weather data.

Also explain files e.g. can go through cleaning and exploration to understand data but not necessary to run those, you just need to run analysis.
